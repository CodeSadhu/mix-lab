Dialogflow Export
===

This directory contains the zip file needed to Restore an app in Dialogflow.

It was exported from the production version of Mix Lab, and slightly modified for generic use.

In order to work with your own application, make sure to update `googleAssistant.project` and `webhook.url` 
in the agent.json file.
